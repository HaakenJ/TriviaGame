# Mountainous Trivia

## A Web Based Trivia Game With A Theme Of The Mountains

  This game will provide the user with six questions testing their knowledge on
various topics regarding mountains; everything from sports in the mountains,
to topics about mountain geography.

  The user is given fifteen seconds to answer each question.  If they select an
answer during that time, they are notified if they were right or wrong, and a 
fun fact is given about that question's answer.  If the user runs out of time
they are notified as such and the fun fact is displayed.  After ten seconds the
next question will be displayed.

  At the end of the game the user is informed of how many correct, incorrect, 
and unanswered questions they had and is given an option to restart the game 
which will reset all scores.
